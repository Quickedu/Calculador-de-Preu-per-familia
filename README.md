# The WeekendsCalculator ðŸ˜Ž

This is a calculator I made one day for my Aunt.
It calculates the price each family or person has to pay when u go for a trip to somewhere or you stay on some place. It accepts you to define who sleeps and who don't (so they pay the double) and the childs pays only half of it's price ðŸ˜„(cool as fck if i'm getting asked)

It asks you things on console, and by answering, it does the calcs for u :D
